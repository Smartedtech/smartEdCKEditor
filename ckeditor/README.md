### For mac: 

* run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000"
for windows, I don't know what to do yet
* then, go to localhost:8000
* kindly allow it to save on the machine and you will be fine.

## Time is my greatest enemy. How I wish I could do more than this.
* Samson should work on the equation, it is just a few step forward, he should add the plugin and that will be fine.

* I will need to have the OS the tabs will be working on so as to know what to do about running the server with a single click.
